# Product Guidelines

## 1. Visual Identity & Aesthetic
-   **Tone:** Professional, Clinical, and Urgent.
-   **Color Palette:**
    -   Primary: Deep Blues and Slate Greys (Trust and Professionalism).
    -   Secondary/Alerts: High-contrast Reds (Danger/Critical), Oranges (Warning/Medium), and Greens (Resolved/Success) to convey urgency.
    -   Backgrounds: Clean whites or very light greys to maintain a clinical feel.
-   **Typography:** Sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Roboto) for maximum legibility in high-stress situations.

## 2. User Experience (UX) Design
-   **Responsiveness:** The public portal must be mobile-friendly, as staff may report issues from handheld devices or bedside terminals.
-   **Clarity over Complexity:** Minimize the number of clicks required to submit a ticket. Priority information (Ticket Number, Status) should always be prominent.
-   **Accessibility:** Ensure high contrast and support for screen readers, adhering to standard web accessibility guidelines.
-   **Visual Cues:** Use color-coded badges for ticket priorities and statuses to allow technicians to scan the queue quickly.

## 3. Writing Style & Tone (Prose)
-   **Voice:** Empathetic, Guiding, and Clear.
-   **Language:** Turkish (Türkçe).
-   **Principles:**
    -   Avoid overly technical jargon in the public portal. Use terms hospital staff understand (e.g., "Yazıcı Sorunu" instead of "Spooler Error").
    -   Provide clear, step-by-step guidance during ticket submission.
    -   System messages should be reassuring (e.g., "Talebiniz alındı, en kısa sürede ilgileneceğiz" instead of "Record Saved").

## 4. Components & Imagery
-   **Icons:** Use minimalist and functional icons (e.g., Heroicons). Stick to recognizable metaphors for IT and support.
-   **Layout:** Use full-width forms where appropriate to prevent cramped interfaces. Use cards and white space to separate different sections of information clearly.
-   **Feedback:** Provide immediate visual feedback for all user actions (e.g., loading spinners, success toasts).
